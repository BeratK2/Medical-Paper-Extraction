However, their metabolism via the cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) pathway poses a high risk of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs), requiring vigilant therapeutic strategies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and interaction profiles of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, emphasizing their differential DDI risks. Among these agents, ribociclib has been associated with a higher risk of QTc prolongation and CYP3A4-mediated interactions in some studies, whereas abemaciclib demonstrates a relatively favorable DDI profile. However, data remain limited and are largely derived from indirect comparisons or pharmacovigilance analyses. We further examine the clinical implications of drug-drug interactions with frequently co-prescribed agents, including proton pump inhibitors, antifungal medications, anticoagulants, and lipid-lowering therapies. Practical recommendations regarding drug selection, therapeutic drug monitoring, and dose adjustment are discussed with attention to the individual characteristics of each CDK4/6i. Dose modifications and monitoring in patients with renal or hepatic impairment are also discussed. Emerging pharmacogenomic data suggest that genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and ABCG2 influence drug exposure and toxicity, reinforcing the need for personalized treatment approaches.

However, long-term PPI therapy leads to several side effects such as delayed gastric emptying and distinct changes in mucosal histology. Therefore, this retrospective study aims to evaluate the impact of preoperative PPI therapy on the anastomotic leak rate after esophagectomy.\nA retrospective, single-center analysis was conducted for all patients treated with esophagectomy and gastric conduit reconstruction between January 2016 and November 2024. Preoperative treatment with PPIs, as well as patient comorbidities, histopathological findings and surgical techniques were noted. Subsequently, a group-wise comparison was carried out for the differences in anastomotic leak rate and postoperative complications in patients with and without preoperative PPI therapy. Finally, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted for the occurrence of anastomotic leak.\nA total of 229 patients were included in the study.

{"title": "Particle Therapy to Overcome Cancer Radiation Resistance: \"ARCHADE\" Consortium Updates in Radiation Biology.", "abstract": "Radiation therapy is a medical treatment that uses high doses of radiation to kill or damage cancer cells. It works by damaging the DNA within the cancer cells, ultimately causing cell death. Radiotherapy can be used as a primary treatment, adjuvant treatment in combination with surgery or chemotherapy or palliative treatment to relieve symptoms in advanced cancer stages. Radiation therapy is constantly improving in order to enhance the effect on cancer cells and reduce the side effects on healthy tissues. Our results clearly demonstrate that proton therapy and, even more, carbon ion therapy appear as promising alternatives to overcome the radioresistance of various tumors thanks to less dependency on oxygen and a better ability to kill cancer stem cells. Interestingly, hadrons also retain the advantages of radiosensitization approaches. These data confirm the great ability of hadrons to spare healthy tissue near the tumor via various mechanisms (reduced lymphopenia, bystander effect, etc.). Technology and machine improvements such as image-guided radiotherapy or particle therapies can improve treatment quality and efficacy (dose deposition and biological effect) in tumors while increasingly sparing healthy tissues. Radiation biology can help to understand how cancer cells resist radiation (hypoxia, DNA repair mechanisms, stem cell status, cell cycle position, etc.), how normal tissues may display sensitivity to radiation and how radiation effects can be increased with either radiosensitizers or accelerated particles. All these research topics are under investigation within the ARCHADE research community in France. By focusing on these areas, radiotherapy can become more effective, targeted and safe, enhancing the overall treatment experience and outcomes for cancer patients. Our goal is to provide biological evidence of the therapeutic advantages of hadrontherapy, according to the tumor characteristics.

While PPIs are recommended for gastroprotection in patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, concerns persist regarding their impact on antiplatelet efficacy, particularly with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).\nThe objective of this study is to analyze and compare the thrombo-embolic risk profiles of various antiplatelet-PPI combinations using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database.\nWe conducted a comprehensive analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to evaluate the thrombo-embolic risk associated with antiplatelet-PPI combinations. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component were calculated to detect safety signals. The interaction signal score (INTSS) was used to assess the protective or harmful effects of adding acetylsalicylic acid to clopidogrel-PPI combinations.\nAnalysis revealed significant safety signals for thrombo-embolic events with clopidogrel-rabeprazole (ROR: 62.67, 95% CI: 38.38-102.32) and clopidogrel-omeprazole (ROR: 6.87, 95% CI: 4.89-9.66) combinations. DAPT-PPI combinations showed comparable safety profiles to monotherapy-PPI combinations. The INTSS analysis suggested a potential protective effect of acetylsalicylic acid when added to clopidogrel-PPI combinations. Genderspecific analysis revealed female predominance in monotherapy complications and male predominance in combination therapy events. Clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospitalization rates, were comparable between groups.\nThis pharmacovigilance analysis suggests that while DAPT-PPI combinations demonstrate acceptable safety profiles, careful consideration should be given to PPI selection, particularly given the unexpected safety signals with rabeprazole and confirmed risks with omeprazole. The addition of acetylsalicylic acid to clopidogrel-PPI combinations may offer protective effects against thrombo-embolic events.

This is an attractive option for treating pediatric patients, who are vulnerable to radiation-induced side effects.

In this study, we therefore explored the potential of PAT in proton therapy of pediatric ependymoma.\nThree-field IMPT and PAT treatment plans for 10 pediatric ependymoma patients were optimized using the Eclipse treatment planning system.

{"title": "Melatonin enhances everolimus efficacy in breast cancer by suppressing mTOR pathway activation and promoting apoptosis and mitochondrial function.", "abstract": "Everolimus is used in the treatment of breast cancer by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, particularly during anti-hormonal therapy. The efficacy of everolimus is limited due to a feedback loop that supresses mTOR while simultaneously enhancing Akt activation in endocrine-resistant breast cancer. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) regulates mitochondrial activity, cell death, and autophagy due to its strong free radical scavenging, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Melatonin, a naturally occurring oncostatic agent, slows tumor growth in a range of malignancies, including breast cancer. Due to its ability to protect healthy cells from oxidative stress and inflammation, along with its anti-cancer properties, melatonin has the potential to serve asan effective adjuvant in breast cancer therapy. It also inhibits the phosphorylation of mTOR and Akt, two essential pathways implicated in breast cancer growth, which may aid in overcoming resistance to targeted treatments like everolimus. The combination effects of melatonin and everolimus on hormone receptor-positive breast cancer remains unexplored. This study examined the effectiveness of melatonin when combined with everolimus for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\nTo investigate the effects of melatonin and everolimus combination, we divided MCF-7 cells into four experimental groups: the control, Melatonin (3 mM), Everolimus (30 nM), and a combination of Melatonin and Everolimus (3 mM\u2009+\u200930 nM). Cell viability, apoptosis, autophagy activation, and mitochondrial function were evaluated using established techniques.\nBased on the cell viability test, the combination of 30 nM everolimus and 3 mM melatonin inhibited phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, which are downstream effectors of the mTOR pathway, and reduced cell growth. In addition, co-administration of melatonin and everolimus increased apoptosis and led to Sub-G1 phase accumulation. LC3 protein expression and LC3 puncta analysis demonstrated autophagic activity. In terms of mitochondrial function, co-administration of melatonin with everolimus did not cause proton leakage or mitochondrial uncoupling, but did restore everolimus-induced respiratory inhibition.\nIn conclusion, melatonin is thought to improve the effectiveness of everolimus by inhibiting mTOR downstream effectors, enhancing apoptosis, activating autophagy, improving mitochondrial respiration, and reducing MCF-7 growth.", "journal": "BMC pharmacology & toxicology", "date": "2025-05-13", "authors": ["\u015eeymaDemirkesen", "Yakup\u0130ria\u011fa\u00e7", "Erdo\u011fan Sel\u00e7uk\u015eeber", "CenkAral"], "doi": "10.1186/s40360-025-00907-1"}
{"title": "Field dispersion in uniformly-excited radial parallel plate waveguides for a compact proton accelerator design.", "abstract": "Proton therapy (PT) is a beneficial modality for treating certain cancers but remains under utilized due in part to the high cost of existing PT devices. Dielectric wall accelerators (DWAs) are a proposed class of coreless induction accelerators that may present a suitable option for compact and affordable PT. To realize a compact device, acceleration modules must be designed to achieve field strengths approaching 100 MV/m delivered as pulses on the order of nanoseconds.\nHere, we examine pulse injection into radial parallel plate waveguides as a means of producing high-intensity, pulsed accelerating fields. We present an approach for understanding the impact of waveguide properties on electromagnetic dispersion as well as a means of accounting for this dispersion to produce suitable accelerating fields.\nGeometric and material properties for a set of waveguides were identified based on existing literature and commonly available materials. An analytic model is presented to describe how waveguide geometry and material affect electromagnetic dispersion in a waveguide. Simulations performed in COMSOL Multiphysics are used to calculate a transfer function for the set of waveguides, which provide a means of determining the waveguides output for arbitrary inputs and vice versa. The simulation results are compared to the analytic solution and used to explore alternate matching conditions at the beampipe of the\u00a0accelerator.\nOverall, radial waveguides provide a passive enhancement of the injected pulse, with enhancement of high-frequency components found to be proportional to the square root of the ratio of outer radius to inner radius of the waveguide. Dispersion in the waveguide caused by the radial propagation of the pulse depends on multiple waveguide properties (outer radius, inner radius, material) and leads to reduced enhancement at lower frequencies. The field enhancement in the waveguides reduces the peak voltage required to achieve the desired accelerating field strength. However, dispersion alters the temporal profile of the applied pulse, resulting in a distorted field at the inner radius. Using the transfer function, it is possible to determine the shape of the pulse required to achieve a suitable accelerating field for a given waveguide design.\nPassive field enhancement occurred in all waveguides and across all frequencies studied in this work. As such, radial parallel plate waveguides could help to reduce the high voltages required from upstream switching networks. The analytic model can be used to select waveguide parameters that provide a suitable enhancement of the upstream voltage pulse to achieve the high field strengths required for a compact accelerator. However, pulse dispersion must be accounted for. If upstream pulse shaping can be achieved to account for electromagnetic dispersion in the waveguide, pulse injection into radial parallel plate waveguides could be a suitable mechanism for field generation in a\u00a0DWA.", "journal": "Medical physics", "date": "2025-05-13", "authors": ["Morgan JMaher", "Christopher MLund", "JulienBancheri", "David GCooke", "JanSeuntjens"], "doi": "10.1002/mp.17868"}
{"title": "Anti-regurgitation infant formulas and antacid medication: match or mismatch?", "abstract": "A perceived need for treatment has led to the development and widespread marketing of various anti-regurgitation (AR) infant formulas, promoted as effective solutions for managing regurgitation symptoms. For practice, limited comparative data exists on the specific thickening agents, or the relative thicknesses of AR formulas. An added concern is that some infants on AR formulas simultaneously receive pharmacological treatments for reflux, such as antacids or gastric acid inhibitors, and no information about compatibility is available. One reference formula (Nutrilon\u00ae Profutura 1, Nutricia) and four formulas labelled as 'anti-regurgitation' with different nutritional compositions were used to evaluate the effect of pH and time on viscosity. The viscosity of marketed AR formulas was tested with a rotational rheometer. All four AR formulas demonstrated higher viscosity compared to the reference formula, with notable differences based on the thickening strategy used by the manufacturer. Pre-thickened CBG-based AR formulas generally showed higher viscosity than pre-thickened starch-based formulas. Adding a casein-dominant protein fraction increased viscosity in acidic environments; however, this effect gradually diminished over time, likely due to protein hydrolysis. Moderate (pH 4) compared to strong acidic conditions (pH 1) had only minimal impact on viscosity, indicating compatibility with gastric acid inhibitors across all AR formulas.\nOur findings suggest that CBG-based AR formulas should be allowed to stand for at least 30\u00a0min after preparation to achieve the intended viscosity. Additionally, AR formulas thickened with CBG generally exhibit higher viscosity than pre-thickened starch-based formulas. Notably, casein-based thickening occurs even when gastric acid suppressants are used, and combining casein with acid suppression may even slow down the rate of viscosity reduction over time.\n\u2022 Commercially available infant formula sometimes uses thickening agents to reduce regurgitation, but their effectiveness may vary depending on composition and gastric conditions. \u2022 Some thickening agents require an acidic environment to activate, which may be compromised by concurrent use of gastric acid suppressants.\n\u2022 This study demonstrates that CBG-based AR formulas generally maintain higher viscosity than starch-based formulas, even with acid suppression. \u2022 Viscosity in some formulas changes over time, indicating that preparation timing affects therapeutic consistency.", "journal": "European journal of pediatrics", "date": "2025-05-13", "authors": ["ElineTommelein", "KyaraBaert", "MathieuOmbecq", "SilkeHenry", "Val\u00e9rieVanhoorne"], "doi": "10.1007/s00431-025-06161-1"}

Effectiveness was assessed on a binary scale, resolution versus non-resolution of disease, after 32 weeks.\nThe primary analysis produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a33421.27 per resolution. After applying quality-adjusted life year (QALY) data from the REFLUX trial (2008), we derived an ICER/QALY of \u00a334 747.32, marginally exceeding the \u00a330\u2009000 threshold set by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. However, further subgroup analysis showed cost-effectiveness when healing severe grades of oesophagitis (ICER/QALY of \u00a322 165.56). The first sensitivity analysis considers the typically non-invasive determination of disease resolution; the ICER/QALY of \u00a315\u2009826.98 supports vonoprazan's use in treating severe oesophagitis. The second considers a longer healing phase alongside a stronger 30\u2009mg maintenance dose of lansoprazole, concordant with current guidelines; the ICER/QALY of \u00a343\u2009998.39 suggests the guidelines (regarding dosage, frequency and duration) must be optimised for vonoprazan. The final sensitivity analysis accounts for variations in quality-of-life measures, which grossly inflate the ICER/QALY (\u00a3118 216.32); this emphasises that vonoprazan should mainly be considered for patients with persistent symptoms and high severity.\nVonoprazan is potentially cost-effective for the initial healing of severe oesophagitis, after endoscopic diagnosis.

Materials and methods Forty-nine\u00a0patients with known gastric acid secretion-related disorders were randomized in two groups. The PPI group was treated with oral omeprazole, while the non-PPI group were given sucralfate and famotidine. Patients were followed up for a period of 12 months and levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, iron, vitamin B12, folate and vitamin D were checked using blood samples at baseline, three-, six-, and 12-month duration. Results The results showed that patients in the PPI group had significantly lower levels of magnesium (1.46 \u00b1 0.15 mEq/L vs. 1.70 \u00b1 0.14 mEq/L, p<0.01), calcium (8.96 \u00b1 0.42 mg/dL vs. 9.50 \u00b1 0.48 mg/dL\u00a0respectively, p<0.01), and vitamin B12 (329.5 \u00b1 134.7 pg/mL vs. 462.30 \u00b1 193.7 pg/mL, p=0.009) as compared to non-PPI group at 12-month duration. Levels of other electrolytes and minerals did not show significant differences amongst both groups.

{"title": "Determination of beam quality correction factors for alanine dosimetry in clinical proton beams.", "abstract": "With the advent of FLASH radiotherapy, alanine dosimetry has gained attention as a promising dosimeter owing to its dose-rate independence. However, before utilized in radiotherapy, procedures for determining the absorbed dose to water using alanine under clinical proton beams must be established. This study sought to develop a formula for alanine dosimetry by deriving beam quality correction factors and validating them through Monte Carlo simulations and experimental measurements.\nTo calculate the absorbed dose to water using alanine dosimeters, a formula was developed specifically for the plateau region. Alanine dosimeters were irradiated under both a reference beam (Cobalt-60) and clinical proton beams. Beam quality correction factors were calculated and subsequently validated through Monte Carlo simulations using the Tool for Particle Simulation (TOPAS), which is based on GEANT4, as well as through experimental measurements. During the simulations, both crystalline and bulk densities of alanine were considered.\nThe simulation results showed that the average beam quality correction factors for alanine were 1.005 for crystalline density and 1.012 for bulk density. Experimental measurements under clinical proton beams yielded a beam quality correction factor of 1.014, with a standard uncertainty of 2.2%.\nThese results suggest that alanine dosimeters provide reliable and reproducible measurements for proton therapy.
